DESCRIPTION
******************************************************

The gprecoverseg utility reactivates failed segment instances.
Once gprecoverseg completes this process, the system will be recovered.

A segment instance can fail for several reasons, such as a host failure, 
network failure, or disk failure. When a segment instance fails, its 
status is marked as down in the HAWQ Database system catalog, 
and the master will random pickup a segment to process query for a session.
In order to bring the failed segment instance back into operation again,
you must first correct the problem that made it fail in the first place, 
and then recover the segment instance in HAWQ Database using gprecoverseg.

Segment recovery using gprecoverseg requires that you have at least one
alive segment to recover from. For systems that do not have alive
segment do a system restart to bring the segments back online (gpstop -r).

By default, a failed segment is restarted in place, meaning that 
the system brings the segment back online on the same host and data 
directory location on which it was originally configured. 

If the data directory was removed or damaged, gprecoverseg can
recovery the data directory (using -F). This requires that you have
at least one alive segment to recover from. 

In some cases, the above method may not be possible (for example, if a
host was physically damaged and cannot be recovered). In this situation, 
gprecoverseg allows you to recover failed segments to a completely 
new host (using -p). In this senario, to prevent HAWQ getting imbalanced workload,
all the segments on the failed host should be moved to the new host.
You must manually kill the other alive segments left on the failed host
before you try to run gprecoverseg.

The new recovery segment host must be pre-installed with the HAWQ 
Database software and configured exactly the same as the existing 
segment hosts. A spare data directory location must exist on all 
currently configured segment hosts and have enough disk space to 
accommodate the failed segments.

The recovery process marks the segment as up again in the HAWQ 
Database system catalog. Use the following command to check the
recovery result.

 $ gpstate

******************************************************
OPTIONS
******************************************************

-a (do not prompt)

Do not prompt the user for confirmation.


-B parallel_processes

The number of segments to recover in parallel. If not specified, 
the utility will start up to four parallel processes depending 
on how many segment instances it needs to recover.


-d master_data_directory

Optional. The master host data directory. If not specified, 
the value set for $MASTER_DATA_DIRECTORY will be used.


-F (full recovery)

Optional. Perform a full copy of the active segment instance 
in order to recover the failed segment. The default is to 
only restart the failed segment in-place.


-l <logfile_directory>

The directory to write the log file. Defaults to ~/gpAdminLogs.


-p <new_recover_host>[,...]

Specifies a spare host outside of the currently configured 
HAWQ Database array on which to recover invalid segments. In 
the case of multiple failed segment hosts, you can specify a 
comma-separated list. The spare host must have the HAWQ Database 
software installed and configured, and have the same hardware and OS 
configuration as the current segment hosts (same OS version, locales, 
gpadmin user account, data directory locations created, ssh keys 
exchanged, number of network interfaces, network interface naming 
convention, and so on.). 

When this option is used, assume the number of
failed hosts is N, you need to specify N new hosts, and make sure that all the 
segments on the failed hosts are marked 'down' before run the command.
If there are still some alive segments on the failed hosts, kill the segments first or
shutdown the failed hosts.


-q (no screen output)

Run in quiet mode. Command output is not displayed on 
the screen, but is still written to the log file.


-v (verbose)

Sets logging output to verbose.


--version (version)

Displays the version of this utility.


-? (help)
Displays the online help.
