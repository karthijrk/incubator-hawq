COMMAND NAME: gpinitstandby

Adds and/or initializes a standby master host for a Greenplum Database system.


*****************************************************
SYNOPSIS
*****************************************************

gpinitstandby { -s <standby_hostname> | -r | -n } 
              [-M smart | -M fast] [-a] [-q] [-D] [-L]
              [-l <logfile_directory>]

 
gpinitstandby -? | -v


*****************************************************
DESCRIPTION
*****************************************************

The gpinitstandby utility adds a backup master host to your 
Greenplum Database system. If your system has an existing backup 
master host configured, use the -r option to remove it before adding 
the new standby master host. 

Before running this utility, make sure 
that the Greenplum Database software is installed on the backup master 
host and that you have exchanged SSH keys between hosts. Also make sure 
that the master port is set to the same port number on the master host 
and the backup master host. This utility should be run on the currently 
active primary master host.
 
The utility will perform the following steps:

* Shutdown your Greenplum Database system
* Update the Greenplum Database system catalog to remove the 
  existing backup master host information (if the -r option is supplied) 
* Update the Greenplum Database system catalog to add the new backup 
  master host information (use the -n option to skip this step)
* Edit the pg_hba.conf files of the segment instances to allow access 
  from the newly added standby master.
* Setup the backup master instance on the alternate master host
* Start the synchronization process
* Restart your Greenplum Database system

A backup master host serves as a 'warm standby' in the event of the 
primary master host becoming unoperational. The backup master is kept 
up to date by a transaction log replication process (gpsyncagent), 
which runs on the backup master host and keeps the data between the 
primary and backup master hosts synchronized. If the primary master 
fails, the log replication process is shutdown, and the backup master 
can be activated in its place by using the gpactivatestandby utility. 
Upon activation of the backup master, the replicated logs are used to 
reconstruct the state of the master host at the time of the last 
successfully committed transaction.


*****************************************************
OPTIONS
*****************************************************

-s <standby_hostname>

The host name of the standby master host.


-r (remove standby master)

Removes the currently configured standby master host from your 
Greenplum Database system.


-n (resynchronize)

Use this option if you already have a standby master configured, 
and just want to resynchronize the data between the primary and 
backup master host. The Greenplum system catalog tables will not 
be updated.


-M fast (fast shutdown - rollback)

Use fast shut down when stopping Greenplum Database at the beginning
of the standby initialization process. Any transactions in progress 
are interrupted and rolled back.


-M smart (smart shutdown - warn)

Use smart shut down when stopping Greenplum Database at the beginning
of the standby initialization process. If there are active connections, 
this command fails with a warning. This is the default shutdown mode.


-L (leave database stopped)

Leave Greenplum Database in a stopped state after removing the warm 
standby master.

-a (do not prompt)

Do not prompt the user for confirmation.


-q (no screen output)

Run in quiet mode. Command output is not displayed on the screen, 
but is still written to the log file.


-l <logfile_directory>

The directory to write the log file. Defaults to ~/gpAdminLogs.


-D (debug)

Sets logging level to debug.


-? (help)

Displays the online help.


-v (show script version)

Displays the version of this utility.


*****************************************************
EXAMPLES
*****************************************************

Add a backup master host to your Greenplum Database system and 
start the synchronization process:

gpinitstandby -s host09


Remove the existing backup master from your Greenplum system configuration:

gpinitstandby -r


Start an existing backup master host and synchronize the data 
with the primary master host - do not add a new Greenplum backup 
master host to the system catalog:

gpinitstandby -n

Note: Do not specify the -n and -s options in the same command.
