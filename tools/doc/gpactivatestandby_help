COMMAND NAME: gpactivatestandby

Activates a standby master host and makes it the active master 
for the Greenplum Database system, or configures a host to be 
the standby master for a Greenplum Database system.

[-f] [-a] [-q] [-l <logfile_directory>]  

gpactivatestandby -? | -h | --help

*****************************************************
DESCRIPTION
*****************************************************


The gpactivatestandby script activates a backup master host and 
brings it into operation as the active master instance for a Greenplum 
Database system. The activated standby master effectively becomes the 
Greenplum Database master, accepting client connections on the master port 
(which must be set to the same port number on the master host and the 
backup master host). 

You must run this script from the master host you are 
activating, not the failed master host you are disabling. Running this 
script assumes you have a backup master host configured for the system 
(see gpinitstandby).

The script will perform the following steps:

* Stop the synchronization process (gpsyncmaster) on the backup master

* Update the system catalog tables of the backup master using the logs

* Activate the backup master to be the new active master for the system

* (optional) Make the host specified with the -c option the new standby 
  master host

* Restart the Greenplum Database system with the new master host

A backup Greenplum master host serves as a warm standby in the event 
of the primary Greenplum master host becoming unoperational. The backup 
master is kept up to date by a transaction log replication process 
(gpsyncmaster), which runs on the backup master host and keeps the 
data between the primary and backup master hosts synchronized. 

If the primary master fails, the log replication process is shutdown, 
and the backup master can be activated in its place by using the 
gpactivatestandby script. Upon activation of the backup master, the 
replicated logs are used to reconstruct the state of the Greenplum master 
host at the time of the last successfully committed transaction. To specify 
a new standby master host after making your current standby 
master active, use the -c option.

In order to use gpactivatestandby to activate a new primary master host, 
the master host that was previously serving as the primary master cannot 
be running. The script checks for a postmaster.pid file in the data 
directory of the disabled master host, and if it finds it there, it will 
assume the old master host is still active. In some cases, you may need 
to remove the postmaster.pid file from the disabled master host data 
directory before running gpactivatestandby (for example, if the 
disabled master host process was terminated unexpectedly).

After activating a standby master, run ANALYZE to update the database 
query statistics. For example:

psql dbname -c 'ANALYZE;'


*****************************************************
OPTIONS
*****************************************************


-d <standby_master_datadir>

Required. The absolute path of the data directory for the master host 
you are activating.


-c <new_standby_master_hostname>

Optional. After you activate your standby master you may want to specify 
another host to be the new standby, otherwise your Greenplum Database 
system will no longer have a standby master configured. Use this option 
to specify the hostname of the new standby master host. You can also use 
gpinitstandby at a later time to configure a new standby master host.


-f (force activation)

Use this option to force activation of the backup master host. 
Only use this option if you are sure that the backup and primary master 
hosts are consistent. This option may be useful if you have just 
initialized a new backup master using gpinitstandby, and want to 
activate it immediately.


-a (do not prompt)

Do not prompt the user for confirmation.


-q (no screen output)

Run in quiet mode. Command output is not displayed on the screen, 
but is still written to the log file.


-l <logfile_directory>

The directory to write the log file. Defaults to ~/gpAdminLogs.


-? | -h | --help

Displays the online help.


-v (show script version)

Displays the version, status, last updated date, and check sum of this script.


--version (show utility version)

Displays the version of this utility.


*****************************************************
EXAMPLES
*****************************************************


Activate the backup master host and make it the active master instance for a 
Greenplum Database system (run from backup master host you are activating):

gpactivatestandby -d /gpdata


Activate the backup master host and at the same time configure another 
host to be your new standby master:

gpactivatestandby -d /gpdata -c new_standby_hostname
