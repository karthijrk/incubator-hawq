*****************************************************
DESCRIPTION
*****************************************************

Greenplum’s gpsnmpd agent is an SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) 
daemon that reports on the health and state of a Greenplum Database 
system by using a set of MIBs (Management Information Bases). MIBs are a 
collection of objects that describe an SNMP-manageable entity; in this 
case, a Greenplum Database system. In a typical environment, gpsnmpd is 
polled by a network monitor and returns information on a Greenplum 
Database system. It currently supports the generic RDBMS MIB and 
typically operates on the master host.

gpsnmpd works in conjunction with the SNMP support that (normally) 
already exists on the Greenplum Database system. gpsnmpd does not 
replace the system snmpd agent that monitors items such as hardware, 
processor, memory, and network functions. However, you can run the 
Greenplum SNMP agent as a stand-alone agent if required.

As a standalone SNMP agent, gpsnmpd listens (on a network socket) for 
SNMP queries, and requires the same extensive configuration as the 
system SNMP agent. 

Greenplum recommends that you run gpsnmpd as a sub-agent to the system 
agent. When it starts, the gpsnmpd sub-agent registers itself with the 
system-level SNMP agent, and communicates to the system agent the parts 
of the MIB of which it is aware. The system agent communicates with the 
SNMP client/network monitoring application and forwards requests for 
particular sections of the MIB to the gpsnmpd sub-agent. Note that the 
gpsnmpd sub-agent communicates with the system agent through UNIX sockets; 
it does not listen on network sockets when used as a sub-agent.

DESCRIPTION
*****************************************************

-s (sub-agent)

Run gpsnmpd as an AgentX sub-agent to the system snmpd process. You do not 
need to use the -x option when using this option.

-b (background)

Run gpsnmpd as a background process.


-c (configuration file)

Specify the SNMP configuration file to use when starting gpsnmpd as a 
stand-alone agent. Note that you can specify any configuration file to 
run gpsnmpd as a stand-alone agent; you do not have to use the 
/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf file (/etc/sma/snmp/ on Solaris platforms). The 
configuration file you use must include a value for rocommunity.


-g (use syslog)

Logs gpsnmpd error messages to syslog


-C (libpq connection string) 

The libpq connection string to connect to Greenplum Database. Note that 
you can run gpsnmpd from a remote system. Depending on your network 
configuration, the gpsnmpd agent can establish a connection and monitor 
a remote Greenplum Database database instance. The configuration string 
can contain the database name, the host name, the port number, the 
username, the password, and other information if required. 

Greenplum recommends using the postgres database in the connection string 
(dbname=postgres). This is the default database if you do not use the –C 
option.

 
-x (address:port of a network interface)

Specify an IP address for a network interface card on the host system, 
and specify a port other than the default SNMP port of 161. This enables 
you to run gpsnmpd without root permissions (you must have root permissions 
to use ports 1024 and lower).

You do not need to specify this option if you are running gpsnmpd as an 
AgentX sub-agent (-s).


-m (MIB:...) 

Loads one or more MIBs when starting gpsnmpd. Use a colon (:) to separate 
the MIBs. Enter ALL to load all MIBs. If you do not enter -m in the gpsnmpd 
command, a default set of MIBs are loaded by default.


-M (directory:...) 

Loads all MIBs from one or more directories when starting gpsnmpd. Use a 
colon (:) to separate the each directory. Enter the full path to each 
directory you specify for this option. If you do not enter -M in the gpsnmpd 
command, a default set of MIBs are loaded by default.


-? (help)

Displays the online help.


-V

Displays the version of this utility.


*****************************************************
EXAMPLES
*****************************************************

Start gpsnmpd as an agentx subagent:

# gpsnmpd -s -b -m ALL -C "host=gpmaster dbname=template1 \ user=gpadmin 
	password=secret"


Start gpsnmpd as a stand-alone agent:

# gpsnmpd -b -c /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf -x \ 192.168.100.12:10161 
	-M /usr/mibs/mymibs -C "host=gpmaster \ dbname=template1 user=gpadmin 
	password=secret"
