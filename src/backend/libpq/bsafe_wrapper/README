The RSA BSAFE library wraps OpenSSL. Some of the OpenSSL library, particularly
BIO (an IO library) has leaked out of BSAFE. Since we also link against OpenSSL,
some of the symbols which we want to bind to the OpenSSL library resolve,
instead, to RSA BSAFE.

If RSA BSAFE was a shared library, this wouldn't be a problem, because shared
libraries can cope with such problems. RSA BSAFE has static library components.
The reason for this is 'security related' (they don't want the shared library to
be replaced on disk with a compromised one).

The solution is to wrap RSA BSAFE in a shared library itself and allow the
linker to take care of the rest.
