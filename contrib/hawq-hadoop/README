Run Unit Test
-------------
All unit tests can be run without starting HAWQ and HDFS, simply run
$ mvn clean test


Run Feature Test
----------------
1. Make sure HAWQ started, and have a database "gptest". We assume
   master's host and port to be localhost:5432, but you can change it
   using the following environment variables
   - PG_BASE_ADDRESS
   - PG_BASE_PORT

2. Make sure HDFS started.
   - HADOOP_HOME    defaults to "/usr/local/hadoop"
